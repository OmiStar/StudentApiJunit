# StudentApiJunit


In This API i have created one stuent method  and i am trying to pass the junit test case on it . 
In junit test case we can able to write test case successfully 
After completion of test case we can see data into database by firing MySQL Query
Selct * From table_name;
After the we need to run our application as spring boot app 
Then we can able to run the application on required port number and with the help of postman we can pass the data into it.
At the end we can able to see that data into database again by using same query.
